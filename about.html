                <h2>WHY URL CLASSIFICATION</h2>
                <p>
                    URL classification is the process of categorizing URLs into different categories based on their
                    content and reputation. It is a crucial task in web security and content filtering. URL
                    classification is used in various applications such as web filtering, parental control, and network
                    security to enhance cybersecurity and protect users from various unknown and known threats like
                    malware and phishing.By analyzing URLs, it helps prevent users from accessing
                    potentially dangerous websites, safeguarding their online security.
